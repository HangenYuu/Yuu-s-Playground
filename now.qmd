# What's I am currently doing now:
## Studying for my bachelor's degree at NTU
My major is chemical engineering, but I love programming.

## Studying the part 2 of fast.ai course
We are creating PyTorch from the ground up! It yields many understanding about Python and PyTorch. It yields many understandings about the design of the framework.

## Documenting my notes here on H's Notes
Just go to a blog post and see one of my entry.

## Working on projects to deepen my understanding
You can see them at my [Github repo](https://tinyurl.com/VisLe). For the philosophy of project-based and just-in-time learning, see  this [post](https://medium.com/@init_27/how-not-to-do-fast-ai-or-any-ml-mooc-3d34a7e0ab8c).
