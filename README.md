This contains the source code for my blog, powered by [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). You can create one for yourself by following the documentation [here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html).
Of course, it is not so straightforward as putting together all these instructions and you are done. I also needed to reference a bunch of Stack Overflow posts and other 
people's experience. A list of helpful resources is here:

- https://forbo7.github.io/forblog/posts/7_blog_subscriptions.html

The list will be updated further in the future.
