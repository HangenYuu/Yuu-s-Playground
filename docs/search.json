    "text": "I want to go into MLOps. One general assumption, reflected by the curriculum is that you need to know a lot about creating a machine learning first before going into MLOps. That is also the normal trajectory of “normal” MLOps. I also believe that you should have knowledge in the model before building one. Alas, I want to dive head first and see what I exactly need to deploy a model, which I believe involve a lot less than my impression. The experience from a recent hackathon also shows that you can easily find a person who can train a model well, but it is hard to find a person who can deploy the model and do all the fancy demo.\n\n\n\nFinding joy in the adventures of Feynman’s again. I loved his humor and his irresponsibility. His story is something to balance with all the depressing meta stories that I expose myself to, and probably continue to."

    "text": "Nassim Nicholas Taleb told me this when he talked about listening to pundits in The Black Swan (or was it Antifragile?). Derek Sivers shared the same idea about talking versus doing. The idea reminds me to pick my words carefully, when I give advice, and when I state my priority. It also reminds to tailor my daily schedule so that the priority is always at the top. (It is a nice idea, by the way, to speak and act on priority as singular rather than plural). The next time you say something, act on it to see if you really believe your words. And the next time you do something, stating clearly how you like doing that."
