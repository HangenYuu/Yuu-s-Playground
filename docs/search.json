    "text": "I want to go into MLOps. One general assumption, reflected by the curriculum is that you need to know a lot about creating a machine learning first before going into MLOps. That is also the normal trajectory of “normal” MLOps. I also believe that you should have knowledge in the model before building one. Alas, I want to dive head first and see what I exactly need to deploy a model, which I believe involve a lot less than my impression. The experience from a recent hackathon also shows that you can easily find a person who can train a model well, but it is hard to find a person who can deploy the model and do all the fancy demo.\n\n\n\nFinding joy in the adventures of Feynman’s again. I loved his humor and his irresponsibility. His story is something to balance with all the depressing meta stories that I expose myself to, and probably continue to."

    "text": "Nassim Nicholas Taleb told me this when he talked about listening to pundits in The Black Swan (or was it Antifragile?). Derek Sivers shared the same idea about talking versus doing. The idea reminds me to pick my words carefully, when I give advice, and when I state my priority. It also reminds to tailor my daily schedule so that the priority is always at the top. (It is a nice idea, by the way, to speak and act on priority as singular rather than plural). The next time you say something, act on it to see if you really believe your words. And the next time you do something, stating clearly how you like doing that."

    "text": "“Don’t trust in your reputation, money, or position, but in the strength that is yours—namely, your judgements about the things that you control and don’t control. For this alone is what makes us free and unfettered, that picks us up by the neck from the depths and lifts us eye to eye with the rich and powerful.” — EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 3.26.34–35\n\nĐừng tin vào danh vọng, tiền bạc, hay vị trí [của bản thân], mà hãy tin vào sức mạnh mà con nắm giữ—khả năng phân biệt giữa thứ mà con có thể kiểm soát và thứ mà con không thể. Bởi đây là thứ duy nhất giúp chúng ta được tự do và không bị ràng buộc, là thứ duy nhất kéo chúng ta thoát khỏi vực thẳm và đưa chúng ta ngang hàng với những kẻ giàu có và quyền lực.\nIt is something that is expected from Epictetus - the emphasis on the dichotomy of control. What surprises me is the last phrase. The ability to exercise the dichotomy of control and act accordingly gives us power and wealth. It is all based on the same principle: to have more, you can acquire more, or you can want less."

    "text": "08 - Nov - 2022\n\n“Remember that you are an actor in a play, playing a character according to the will of the playwright—if a short play, then it’s short; if long, long. If he wishes you to play the beggar, play even that role well, just as you would if it were a cripple, a honcho, or an everyday person. For this is your duty, to perform well the character assigned you. That selection belongs to another.” — EPICTETUS, ENCHIRIDION, 17\n\nHãy nhớ rằng con là một diễn viên trong một vở kịch [mang tên cuộc đời], diễn một vai theo ý muốn của người viết kịch—nếu đó là một vở kịch ngắn, thì diễn ngắn; nếu nó dài, thì diễn dài. Nếu người viết kịch muốn con đóng vai một kẻ ăn mày, vậy thì hãy diễn vai đó thật tốt, cũng tương tự như vậy nếu con nhận được vai kẻ bị thọt, người đứng đầu, hay chỉ là một người bình thường. Bởi việc diễn thật tốt vai đã được giao chính là nghĩa vụ của con. Việc chọn vai nào [cho con] thuộc về những người khác.\nNow the last sentence raised my eyebrows. What? Let’s others choose for me? Ins’t that antithetical to “Essentialism”? That I need to prioritize my life instead of letting others prioritize it for me! But be calm - Epictetus did not talk about letting others choose. The others here referred to the higher being, chance, luck i.e. anything that we cannot control. It is probable that the course of our life is led to stranger lands because of some accidents. However, we are still in control: we can choose to get back on track after being thrown off-trackor not. That alone is important, that alone is enough."

I will admit that I know next to nothing about data engineer, so the following came from a certain “God-tier” roadmap that I picked up. (I am weak again anything “God-tier”, so please refrain from using that against me). I will guess that the job requirements will vary. The data you need to work on may just be stored in a single AWS S3, but there are cases where the data are distributed in 23 data centers around the world, and you need Vitess on top of MySQL to handle the requests successfully (totally not Youtube).
