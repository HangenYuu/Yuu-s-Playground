    "text": "I want to go into MLOps. One general assumption, reflected by the curriculum is that you need to know a lot about creating a machine learning first before going into MLOps. That is also the normal trajectory of “normal” MLOps. I also believe that you should have knowledge in the model before building one. Alas, I want to dive head first and see what I exactly need to deploy a model, which I believe involve a lot less than my impression. The experience from a recent hackathon also shows that you can easily find a person who can train a model well, but it is hard to find a person who can deploy the model and do all the fancy demo.\n\n\n\nFinding joy in the adventures of Feynman’s again. I loved his humor and his irresponsibility. His story is something to balance with all the depressing meta stories that I expose myself to, and probably continue to."
