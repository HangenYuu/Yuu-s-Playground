Hello readers, this is Hung, a machine learning engineer-to-be. This blog was created to document my learning process, and this post was the first technically heavy one I wanted to create.

For the first blog post, I picked data analysis, because that is the first thing that an MLE needs to do when receiving the data (assuming that) 

The original datasets were taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps)
