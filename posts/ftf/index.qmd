This is my first post  documenting my journey to become a machine learning engineer/data scientist. You can consider this post as the answer to why I have written "machine learning engineer/data scientist", not just "machine learning engineer" or just "data scientist". Short answer: the definition (responsibilities and skills) varies from company to company. Long answer: read down.

# Machine Learning (ML), Artificical Intelligence (AI), Data Science (DS):
AI is the catch-all phrase to describe techniques that make machines display "intelligence" similar to humans in some sense. The most famous example is the ability to recognize a cat in the picture. ML is a part of AI, sepcifically a goal of "leveraging data to improve performance of machine". Side note: Deep learning (DL) is an approach in AI. One good way to think about ML: whatever model, it is trying to fit a function to the data at hand. DL tries to accomplish this with neural network, which was proved to be able to simulate *any* continuous function (with enough network size and data) and to have stellar results.

DS is the science of extracting insights from data. Simply put, it is statistics paired with human expertise. One example is sabermetrics, and if you want some entertainment, watch *Moneyball*. ML techniques, because of their usefulness, have found their way into DS with success, to put it mildly.

A key takeaway from this is the emphasis on *data*. All the shiny models and dashboards  will cease to exist without data. So whatever you want, being able to work with data is expected.

Next, we will try to answer the question "What exactly is working with data?" by turning to the field of business analytics.

# Business Analytics:
For any reader who feels this violent jump is troublesome, we will likely to work for a company a.k.a a business. And in business, data science is called business analytics, or business intelligence. It is totally okay and possible to work in data science outside a business, such as trying to find out if the legalization of abortion in the US reduced crime rate (this is definitely not a *Freakonomics* reference). 

Simply put, business analytics is data science in the context of a business. From data about past performnace of the company, you want to extract insights to improve in the future i.e. predict whether a new service will be well-received by customers or not, etc. Business analytics are divided into 3 stages:

1. **Descriptive Analytics**: If you are thinking about descriptive statistics when you read this, bingo. The goal at this stage is to uncover historical trends and anomalies. We capture that with mean, median, standard deviation, quantiles, inter-quarter range, etc. Little ML is involved at this stage. One example is analyzing the relationships between favourite artists and genres of music of the subscribers to the music streaming service.

2. **Predictive Analytics**: This is when ML models come into play. The goal of this stage is to make inference about the future from the patterns we dig out in the last stage. To continue with the example, now we want to predict user's ratings to a new artist that we may introduce to them through our streaming app.

3. **Prescriptive Analytics**: From the insights of previous stages, now we can formulate strategy and take actions to benefit from the predicted outcomes. It means going on and recommend new artists of the same genre to an user whom you are quite certain will respond positively to the recommendations, and not doing so otherwise.

The jobs and responsibilities of a data-whoever varies based on the stage they are at. Let's explore this in-depth.

# The easily distinguished jobs:

## Data Analyst:
For a data analyst, his job is mainly stage 1.
Responsibilities:

1. Extracting the data: more colloquially, getting your hand on the data. The most common and case is your your company data engineer's team has set up a pipeline and send you instructions on how to get the data by API.
2. Cleaning and exploring the data: this happens in two stages. First, you try to summarize and detect patterns and anomalies in the data. Second, you try to find the reasons (if not already known) behind these patterns and anomalies from the data.
3. Reporting the insights to stakeholders: often in a meeting or a written report. You will need to present what you have found and the (suspected) reasons behind your findings.

To get the job done, you will need to know:

1. Using SQL and API to get the data.
2. Data processing: applications such as the good ol' Excel, Tableau, Power BI, or language-specific modules such as the combo Pandas/Matplotlib/Seaborn/Numpy in Python. (I confess that I do not use R and not sure about the combo for R, so I just put data.table/ggplot2 here for R folks). The data processing tool is for data exploration and data visualization (both to understand the data and to report later in meatings.) 
3. Writing report: Microsoft Word and PowerPoint are all you need. For R folks, they have R markdown and modules such as knitr to create report. Python folks can try Quarto, which can publish Jupyter Notebook to Microsoft Words and get you a beautiful report! (just make sure to read the documentation). (Fun fact: this blog is powered by Quarto!). But again, if you find these too complicated, Microsoft Word and PowerPoint are all you need.

## Data Engineer:
As a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6991442210093219840/) post suggested, a data engineer's job is "being in charge of the data pipeline", making sure that people such as data scientists can have the data to do their jobs. I will admit that I know next to nothing about data engineer, so the following came from a certain ["God-tier" roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgCavqDntlQ) that I picked up. (I am weak again anything "God-tier", so please refrain from using that against me). I will guess that the job requirements will vary. The data you need to work on may just be stored in a single AWS S3, but there are cases where the data are distributed in 23 data centers around the world, and you need Vitess on top of MySQL to handle the requests successfully (totally not Youtube). In any case, a quick rundown of the "God-tier" roadmap reviews that you need:

1. SQL (and NoSQL)
2. Database system knowledge (data lake, data warehouse, etc.)
3. Linux a.k.a working with command line interface (CLI)
4. Big data framework (Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, depends on your company)
5. Cloud service knowledge (Google Cloud Product (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), or Microsoft Azure - depends on your company)
6. Containerization technology: Docker (and Kubernetes)

Now onto the confusing topic...

## Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer:
First, let's start with a diagram from DataCamp.
